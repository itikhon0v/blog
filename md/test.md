# Sample Article: Markdown Test

## Introduction

Welcome to this test article. It showcases the various features of Markdown formatting, along with some raw HTML. We'll use both **Latin** and **Cyrillic** texts in this article.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but it’s commonly used to format text on websites like GitHub.

> **Quote Section**  
> This is a blockquote to demonstrate the design. Here's some Cyrillic text: Пример текста на кириллице.

### Features of Markdown

- **Bold** and *italic* formatting.
- Code blocks and inline code.
- Lists:
    - First item
    - Second item
    - Third item
- Tables
- Raw HTML

#### Example Code Block

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
````

This is an example of a fenced code block in Markdown. It's styled with a monospace font.

### Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

### HTML Example

Here's an example of a raw HTML block within a Markdown file:

<div class="alert">
    <p>This is an HTML block inside Markdown content.</p>
</div>

### Image with Caption

![Sample Image](https://via.placeholder.com/300)
*This is a sample image with a caption.*

### Form Elements

<input type="checkbox" checked> This is a checkbox.

### Footer

This is the footer of the article. It uses a smaller font size to fit the design.

**Thank you for reading!**
This concludes the Markdown test article with various elements. Here’s one last sentence in Cyrillic: Спасибо за внимание.
